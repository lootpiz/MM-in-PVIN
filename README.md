> Molecular Markers in Parvalbumin Interneurons

## Preface
Welcome to the code repository for our recent publication titled **Spatial Transcriptomics Revealed Alzheimer’s Disease Associated Molecular Markers in Parvalbumin Interneurons**. 

This repository serves as a comprehensive collection of R scripts that were developed to support the methodologies and analyses presented in our research.

You will find code organized in a structured manner (01-11_*.R for GeoMx and 20-30_*.R for Xenium data analyses), allowing for easy navigation and understanding of the various components utilized in our study. This transparency not only facilitates reproducibility of our results but also provides a valuable resource for those interested in exploring similar methodologies.

Feel free to explore the repository, utilize the scripts as needed, and reach out if you have any questions or require further clarification on specific aspects of the code.

Thank you for your interest in our work!

## Prerequisite
You will need to install the Spatial Omics Toolkit (SOTK) to run the scripts and please visit [the GitHub page](https://github.com/UC-ASOC/SOTK) for more information.

## Results/Figures
All results genarated from the scripts are compiled into HTML pages and you visit and browser the web here: ​​[https://ASOC.ucalgary.ca/publication/MM-in-PVIN/](https://ASOC.ucalgary.ca/publication/MM-in-PVIN/)
